## Features Implemented

### Admin/Staff Roles
Only staff members at Allegiance Athletics can have an account on this trainer scheduling web application and these accounts are created by the client and others who have the admin role. These assigned roles give the user privileges to access certain pages on the web application and will deny the staff from seeing admin-only pages. Admin has access to every page and privileges to add, edit, and delete content.

### Announcements
The Announcements view on the homepage allows for the user to see updates that the admin posted. Users with the staff role cannot create a new announcement, however, the admin can create, edit and delete announcements that are created. The buttons for these abilities will only show up in the admin view, so the staff cannot go to these pages.

### Availabilities
The user with the staff role will be able to add/update their availability for the week by using a click, draggable calendar that saves the availability for the admin to see. Staffs can only see their own calendar, however, the admin has the ability to view all the staff’s availability on one calendar and even toggle what they want to view on their availability calendar. The admin role can select buttons to see one particular staff availability or see all at the same time.

There is a search bar that the users can use to search for keywords in any of the entries. Entries can be edited/deleted by the user who created the entry or by the admin who has access to modify any entry.
